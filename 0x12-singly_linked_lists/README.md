# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists

> A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.  
> In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
> A new element can be inserted at the beginning or at the end in constant time (in doubly linked lists).
> Memory utilization is efficient as it's allocated when we add new elements to a list and list size can increase/decrease as required.
> They are useful when the size of a list is unknown and changes frequently. It uses a node that stores data and a pointer to the next node.
