# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

> When you declare variables or when you use strings within double quotes, the program is taking care of all the memory allocation. You do not have to think about it.  
> The arguments and the local variables are stored automatically in memory when the function is called. The program reserves space and uses it without you having to think about it.  
> The `malloc` function is used to allocate a certain amount of memory during the execution of a program.  
> It will request a block of memory from the heap.  
> If the request is granted, the operating system will reserve the requested amount of memory and `malloc` will return a pointer to the reserved space.  

> When the amount of memory is not needed anymore, you must return it to the operating system by calling the function `free`.

> Syntax: 
`void *malloc(size_t size)` where `size` âˆ’ is the size of the memory block, in bytes.

### 0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee

`char *create_array(unsigned int size, char c)` - a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.  

### 1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings
