# 0x10. C - Variadic functions

> Variadic functions are functions that can take a variable number of arguments. In C programming, a variadic function adds flexibility to the program.  
> It takes one fixed argument and then any number of arguments can be passed.  
> The variadic function consists of at least one fixed variable and then an ellipsis(â€¦) as the last parameter.  

**Syntax:**

	 int function_name(data_type variable_name, ...);  

> Values of the passed arguments can be accessed through the header file named as:  

	 #include <stdarg.h>
